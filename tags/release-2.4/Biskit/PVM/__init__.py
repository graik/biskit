"""
High-level parallelisation with PVM.

Python jobs can be distributed from a TrackingJobMaster to many
JobSlaves running on different machines. The general mechanism is shown in
ExampleMaster.py and ExampleSlave.py 

The compilation of PVM/pypvm can be tricky on some architectures. In order
to support installations that don't need parallelisation, only a warning is
issued if pypvm is missing and the public classes are exported as
Pseudo-classes. Pseudo classes are empty and raise an ImportError when you
try to initialize them. See also L{Biskit.tools.tryImport}.
