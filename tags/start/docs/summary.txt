Biskit -- Summary
-----------------

Biskit is a modular, object-oriented python library that provides
intuitive classes for many typical tasks of structural bioinformatics
research. It fascilitates the manipulation and analysis of
macromolecular structures, protein complexes, and molecular dynamics
trajectories. At the same time, Biskit offers a software platform for
the rapid integration of external programs and new algorithms into
complex structural bioinformatics workflows. Calculations are thus
often delegated to established programs like Xplor, Amber, Hex, Prosa,
and Hmmer; interfaces to further software can be added easily.
Moreover, Biskit simplifies the parallelisation of calculations via
PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine).

The library is complemented by two application packages: one automates
the homology modelling of protein structures and is centered around
Blast, T-Coffee, and Modeller. The second package implements a
strategy for flexible protein-protein docking and is (among other
programs) relying on Hex and XPlor. Additional applications automate
or fascilitate more specific tasks like, for example, the setup of
molecular dynamics simulations or the calculation of conformational
entropies.

Biskit has been jointly developped by Raik Gruenberg (Institut
Pasteur) and Johan Leckner (Chalmers University, Goeteborg, Sweden)
with important contributions from Michael Habeck (Max-Planck-Institut
für Entwicklungsbiologie, Tuebingen, Germany), Michael Nilges
(Institut Pasteur), Wolfgang Rieping (Institut Pasteur) and others.

Licensing and publication
-------------------------

The Biskit library relies on several external software libraries
(Numeric, Scientific Python, BioPython, and others) that are subject
to the GNU General Public License (GPL). For this reason, we are
legally obliged to publish Biskit under the same (or a compatible)
open source software license which prohibits a direct commercialisation of
this software. The publication will be crucial to fascilitate ongoing
collaborations and to ensure the continuing development of this software
project. We do not see any commercial potential in Biskit (1) because
of the legal requirement to publish it as open source (or to not
publish it at all) and (2) because other python libraries with similar
functionalities exist and are freely available (see
http://biopython.org/scriptcentral/). 

We therefore kindly ask the Pasteur Institute to waive potential
exploitation rights and to authorize the publication of Biskit under
the GNU General Public License
(http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).
