Testing your Biskit setup
*************************

Each Biskit module comes with its own test class. All the input data needed
to run the tests is checked into the project and can be found in the folder 
*~biskit/test*. The tests are independent of each other and there is no 
need to execute them in a specific order. 

Many of the tests write an output to disc. The directory used for the output is the folder given by
*tempfile.tempdir*, normally */tmp*. The tests will not remove the files and 
directories written, you will have to do that yourself.

-------

Testing a single module:
========================
To test a single module just execute the test code within the module. 

-------

Testing the full installation:
==============================
Testing of the full installation is facilitated by a script
*~biskit/test/test.py*. This script accepts a few options. The most
usfull option is *-tests* that decides what tests to run. The default setting
*all exclude_long* takes approximately 10 minutes to run. To run *all* tests 
will probably take about 20 minutes (depending on your system).

To get the help from the script: 

>>> ./test.py -HELP 


Results in something like::

  Run unittest tests for biskit.

  log	- str, path to logfile that will be written
  verb  - int, verbosity level
  tests - [str], list of the test suits to be run, one or more of::

	     biskit	    - most Biskit modules
	     biskit_app     - Biskit modules calling external applications
	     biskit_pvm     - Biskit modules using PVM
	     dock	    - most Biskit.Dock modules
	     dock_app	    - Biskit.Dock modules calling
				external applications
	     dock_app_long  - time-consuming Biskit.Dock modules calling
				external applications (full test)
	     dock_pvm	    - Biskit.Dock modules using PVM
	     mod	    - all Biskit.Mod modules
	     mod_long	    - time-consuming Biskit.Mod modules (full test)
	     dock_pvm	    - Biskit.Dock modules using PVM
	     dock_pvm_long  - time-consuming Biskit.Dock modules
				using PVM (full test)
	     stat	    - Biskit.Statistics modules
	     pvm	    - Biskit.PVM modules

	  Or one or more of the groups::

	     all	 - all tests
	     all_mod	 - all Biskit.Mod tests
	     all_dock	 - all Biskit.Dock tests
	     all_biskit  - all Biskit tests

	  To exclude tests::

	     exclude_long  - don't run time-consuming tests
	     exclude_pvm   - dont run tests using PVM


  Default options:

        - tests         ['all', 'exclude_long']
        - verb  2
        - log   /mnt/data/shared_bin/biskit/test/test.log
