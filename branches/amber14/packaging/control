Description: A Python platform for structural bioinformatics
  Biskit is a modular, object-oriented Python library for structural
  bioinformatics research. It facilitates the manipulation and analysis
  of macromolecular structures, protein complexes, and molecular
  dynamics trajectories. For efficient number crunching, Biskit objects
  tightly integrate with numpy. Biskit also offers a platform for the
  rapid integration of external programs and new algorithms into complex
  workflows. Calculations are thus often delegated to established
  programs like Xplor, Amber, Hex, Prosa, T-Coffee, TMAlign, Reduce and
  Modeller; interfaces to further software can be added easily.
