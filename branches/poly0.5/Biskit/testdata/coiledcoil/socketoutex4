Found beginning of residue data
There are 81 alpha-helical residues in this structure

chain A starts at residue    1
DSSP file doesnt match PDB file: 0
WARNING: residue 14 (17 A) in the DSSP file is 'X' and does not match the PDB file; a possible reason is that this residue is stored as HETATM rather than ATOM records; please check the PDB file
chain B starts at residue    1
DSSP file doesnt match PDB file: 0
WARNING: residue 41 (17 B) in the DSSP file is 'X' and does not match the PDB file; a possible reason is that this residue is stored as HETATM rather than ATOM records; please check the PDB file
chain C starts at residue    1
DSSP file doesnt match PDB file: 0
WARNING: residue 66 (17 C) in the DSSP file is 'X' and does not match the PDB file; a possible reason is that this residue is stored as HETATM rather than ATOM records; please check the PDB file
